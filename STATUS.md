## ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE: CLOUDINARY CONNECTION

### Problem
Cloudinary image upload integration is **configured correctly** but failing due to network connectivity issues:

```
Error: ETIMEDOUT / ENETUNREACH
- Unable to reach Cloudinary API servers
- Configuration is correct (credentials, code setup)
- Basic web connectivity works, but API endpoints are blocked/timing out
```

### Current Image Handling
- **Existing products**: Using local image paths (`/uploads/...`)
- **New uploads**: Would fail to upload to Cloudinary
- **Display**: Local images still work for existing products

### Options to Resolve

1. **Network Troubleshooting** (Recommended):
   - Check firewall/security settings
   - Try from a different network
   - Contact network administrator about Cloudinary API access

2. **Alternative Cloud Solutions**:
   - Try Imgur API (free, simpler)
   - Use AWS S3 with free tier
   - Try Firebase Storage

3. **Hybrid Approach**:
   - Keep local storage as fallback
   - Add retry mechanism for Cloudinary uploads

## üöÄ READY FOR TESTING

The website is **fully functional** except for new image uploads. You can:

1. **Browse the website**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Access admin panel**: http://localhost:3000/admin
   - Username: `doctor`
   - Password: `ayurveda123`
3. **Manage existing content**: Products, doctor profile, brand settings
4. **View existing products**: Works with local images

## üìã NEXT STEPS

1. **Test admin panel functionality** through the web interface
2. **Resolve Cloudinary connectivity** or choose alternative
3. **Add sample content** (products, doctor photo, brand logo)
4. **Final testing** of all features
5. **Production deployment** preparation

The core application is solid and ready for use!
